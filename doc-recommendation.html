    <h1 class="page-header" id="documentation_style_and_format_recommendation_for_the_project">Documentation style and format recommendation for the project</h1>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The following recommendations apply to text provided as part of project sources
(including the <code>README</code>, <code>AUTHORS</code> and <code>LICENSE</code> files mandated in

<a href="class.html">CLASS (C Language Style for Scalability)</a> and in-line comments
which may be parsed into text files and further into generated documentation)
in order to facilitate a common style of original readable textual content,
and to minimize the amount of tools needed to re-process it into different
end-user formats.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

Indicate Requirement Levels</a>").</p></div>

<p>
Guidelines regarding plaintext markup formats:
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Documentation provided and maintained as part of the project SHALL NOT
use file formats that require non-FOSS software for processing. Plaintext
files are preferred for text documentation, PNG for raster graphics and
SVG for vector graphics. Project SHOULD consider that the build farm hosts
MAY not have installed the graphical environment and desktop/GUI document
processing software, so optional generation of documentation in formats
comfortable for end-user consumption SHOULD rely on common processing
tools outlined in the <a href="#dependencies">"Dependencies"</a> section of CLASS.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Committed text and documentation files SHOULD use <code>asciidoc</code> markup if
they are structured (including sources for "man" pages, project standards
and contracts, user or developer instructions, etc.)
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
For details on the syntax and examples of <code>asciidoc</code> markup see
<a href="http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/">http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/</a> and its source
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor.org/master/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference.adoc">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor.org/master/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference.adoc</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
There are various reasonable choices for some aspect of text formatting
and style. Whichever one is picked, it SHOULD apply to the whole document
or its considerably large portions (e.g. lists of items, as detailed below).
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Texts MAY be in other markups (e.g. plain ASCII, or markdown) only if
they were originally imported from other sources or projects, and if regular
subsequent synchronisation, re-import or other comparison to origin of
these files is anticipated (e.g. a copy of the standard text of a license
chosen by the project, or third party project sources co-distributed as a
dependency&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;where such projects encourage co-distribution rather than
release/package dependencies with a clean separation of borders), or if
the text file is unstructured (e.g. a line-by-line list of authors without
categories&#8230; note that almost anything else is inherently structured).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Project building recipes MAY assume by default that <code>asciidoc</code> program
is the proper tool for processing of committed (or interim generated) text
files into other end-user formats, such as MAN, HTML or PDF variants of the
documentation. Any other cases should be specifically handled by the recipes
as exceptions to the common rule.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
It is RECOMMENDED that source text files using <code>asciidoc</code>-compatible
markup be named with an <code>.asciidoc</code> or <code>.adoc</code> extension (consistently for
the whole project), rather than the common indeterminate <code>.txt</code> extension
or lack of any extension.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
It is RECOMMENDED that text files in non-<code>asciidoc</code> compatible markups
use their appropriate extensions (e.g. <code>.md</code> for MarkDown), rather than a
common indeterminate <code>.txt</code> extension or lack of any extension.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Guidelines on use of whitespaces and blank lines:
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Paragraphs, separate lists of items, code example blocks and other similar
groupings of content lines processed specially by the rendering tools SHALL
be separated (preceded and followed) by at least one blank line. Section
headers MAY be visibly stressed by preceding or surrounding them with two
blank lines; if picked, this formatting option should be applied consistently
to the whole document.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Trailing whitespace characters (SPACE, TAB) and lines fully consisting of
whitespace SHOULD be avoided.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Sequences of more than one whitespace (e.g. two or more SPACE characters in
a row) SHOULD be avoided, wherever such sequences are not part of indentation
or do not carry other contextual meaning.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If a style is picked to separate sentences in a paragaph with a period <code>.</code>
followed by two SPACE characters, this style SHALL be used consistenly in
the whole document.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Depending on contents, one of several formatting styles may be applicable
to lists of items:
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Lines of bulleted or numbered lists SHALL have the same style regarding a
final punctuation character, consistent within at least the list itself&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;usually semicolon <code>;</code> for relatively short entries, period <code>.</code> for full
sentences (especially when there are several sentences per list item), and
a comma <code>,</code> optionally with trailing conjunctions (<code>and</code>/<code>or</code>)  for shortest
entries that can be read together as parts of a larger sentence; and the last
line of the list SHALL end with a period <code>.</code> character.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
An alternative style is to have <em>no trailing punctuation</em> for list items
which otherwise are each a single regular sentence. For lists represented
with such choice of style, the consistent option is that the last line also
has no punctuation (no period <code>.</code>) as its last character.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If an explanatory (semi-)sentence or paragraph precedes such a list, that
sentence SHOULD end with a colon <code>:</code> followed by a blank line (for <code>asciidoc</code>
markup). If the preceding sentence or paragraph is not an introduction into
the contents of the list, it SHOULD be formatted as a usual paragraph, ending
with a period <code>.</code> character.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Nested lists are considered as separate lists; the last line of each such
list at the same level of indentation SHALL end with a period <code>.</code> character
(if any punctuation is used to terminate preceding lines of this list).
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Standard ASCII characters SHALL be preferred over equivalents from the
extended Unicode range, such as:
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
three period characters <code>...</code> over an an ellipsis character "&#8230;", or
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
the numerous ways to type a single or double quote, or
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
the use of plain "minus" <code>-</code> or double-minus <code>--</code> characters over different
long-dash characters, and
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
use of <code>asciidoc</code> (or equivalent) plaintext markup like <code>(TM)</code> or <code>(C)</code>
instead of singular characters like &#8482; or &#169;.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Guidelines regarding example code blocks with command-line interfaces:
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
It is RECOMMENDED to precede documentation examples of command-line usage
of Unix shell constructs with the colon+semicolon <code>:;</code> as the placeholder
of interactive shell prompt at start of a line followed by a single space
character (this allows for easy copying and pasting of multi-line examples
from documentation into command line, since the sequence would be interpreted
by most shells as a non-fatal and non-consequential operation, running or
short-circuiting the <code>true</code> command in place of the colon <code>:</code> character).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
For similar reasons it is RECOMMENDED to parametrize the probable variables
in the example shell code snippets (such as URLs or filenames), especially if
they are repeated more than once.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Likewise, it is RECOMMENDED to organize logical chains (where the subsequent
command should only be executed if a previous one did not fail) using the <code>&amp;&amp;</code>
shell sequence.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If the example command-line is longer than 70 characters, it SHOULD be
split into multiple lines "concatenated" by trailing backslash as is common
in shell scripts; continuation lines SHOULD be indented by at least the
length of the shell prompt placeholder (3 spaces for the <code>:;</code> recommended
prompt and separator that follows).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If the command-line example block includes output from the command to be
entered by the reader, the example command SHOULD be separated by a blank
line from the sample (or expected) output.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If multiple related but separate example code lines follow each other in
the same example code block, they MAY be presented without blank lines in
between. However, if there is also sample output, the rule above applies,
and if the example commands continue after the sample output, it is
additionally RECOMMENDED to separate the output from next commands by
two blank lines.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If an explanatory (semi-)sentence or paragraph precedes example code, that
sentence SHOULD end with a colon <code>:</code> followed by a blank line (for <code>asciidoc</code>
markup). If the preceding sentence or paragraph is not an introduction into
the contents of the example, it SHOULD be formatted as a usual paragraph,
ending with a period <code>.</code> character.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If the sentence after a source-code example effectively continues the
sentence interjected by the block with source-code example, that continuation
line SHOULD start with triple-dots and a lower-case character in the first
word. For clarity, it is RECOMMENDED to phrase the text in such a manner
that singular sentences are not "interrupted" by large blocks of example code.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Other typographical conventions as applicable to plaintext documents:
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Line lengths SHOULD NOT exceed 78 characters, and SHOULD NOT vary greatly
in the middle of a paragraph (the RECOMMENDED line length ranges from 66 to
76 characters).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Long paragraphs broken into several lines SHALL use whole-word wrapping.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In-line short ranges of "verbatim" text, such as filenames and keywords,
SHALL be enclosed in backticks `` (for asciidoc markup, or its equivalent
for other formats). Verbatim text SHALL NOT be decorated otherwise (italic,
bold, underline) if the surrounding text in the paragraph is not decorated so.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Introduction or other stressing of terminology SHOULD be enclosed in double
quotes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Sentences separated by a tiree (long-dash) SHALL use a sequence of two
"minus" characters <code>--</code> surrounded by single SPACE characters; if such
separation happens at end of a line, then the two minuses preceded by a
SPACE character SHALL be the last characters in the line (no trailing SPACE,
and no lines starting with a carried-over double-minus).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Words joined by a dash, mathematical negative numbers and substrations
SHALL use a single "minus" <code>-</code> character without surrounding whitespace.
If such separation happens at end of a line, then the "minus" character
SHALL be the last characters in the line (no trailing SPACE, and no lines
starting with a carried-over minus).
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The same markup recommendation (<code>asciidoc</code> or plain-text ASCII preference)
applies to contents of the blocks of in-code comments in programmatic source
code files and scripts, which may be parsed out into separate text files
and rendered or otherwise automatically processed to become man-pages,
HTML pages for up-to-date website documentation, etc., by default&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;unless
the chosen and agreed tool set to generate documentation from source code
for the whole project dictates another specific markup (JavaDoc, Doxygen,
etc.&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and such tool and markup should be consistent for all of the
project&#8217;s code in a specific programming language).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Written documentation intended for consumption in non-plaintext markup (e.g.
converted to PDF, MAN or HTML pages) and proposed changes to such documentation
SHOULD be inspected in a final processed format by author before committing the
pull request: it may happen that escape characters, careful line breaks, etc.
in the source markup are needed for the final document to be rendered properly.
It is RECOMMENDED that such final format be also checked with a programmatic
spell-checker (for example in a desktop word processor program), in order to
avoid "typos" and subsequent pull requests to fix them.</p></div>
